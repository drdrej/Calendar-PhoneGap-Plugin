# PhoneGap Calendar plugin

for iOS and Android, 
based on parts of impl. of original plugin, written by : [Eddy Verbruggen](http://www.x-services.nl)

This branch contains different android-implementation written by me and some changes for iOS.
API is the same (check Calendar.js).

I use this impl in some of my projects.

Fore more info check Eddy's original [repository](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin)

Install itfrom CLI:

```
$ phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/drdrej/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
```
or
```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/drdrej/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
```



### Manually

1\. Add the following xml to your `config.xml`:
```xml
<!-- for iOS -->
<feature name="Calendar">
	<param name="ios-package" value="Calendar" />
</feature>
```

```xml
<!-- for Android -->
<feature name="Calendar">
  <param name="android-package" value="nl.xservices.plugins.Calendar" />
</feature>
```

Extends plugin-Code manually:

```java


```

2\. Grab a copy of Calendar.js, add it to your project and reference it in `index.html`:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/Calendar.js"></script>
```

3\. Download the source files for iOS and/or Android and copy them to your project.

iOS: Copy `Calendar.h` and `Calendar.m` to `platforms/ios/<ProjectName>/Plugins`

Android: Copy `Calendar.java` to `platforms/android/src/nl/xservices/plugins` (create the folders)

### PhoneGap Build

Using Calendar with PhoneGap Build requires these simple steps:

1\. Add the following xml to your `config.xml` to always use the latest version of this plugin:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.calendar" />
```
or to use this exact version:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.calendar" version="1.0" />
```

2\. Reference the JavaScript code in your `index.html`:
```html
<!-- below <script src="phonegap.js"></script> -->
<script src="js/plugins/Calendar.js"></script>
```


## 3. Usage

Basic operations, you'll want to copy-paste this for testing purposes:

```javascript
  // prep some variables
  var startDate = new Date("September 24, 2013 13:00:00");
  var endDate = new Date("September 24, 2013 14:30:00");
  var title = "My nice event";
  var location = "Home";
  var notes = "Some notes about this event.";
  var success = function(message) { alert("Success: " + JSON.stringify(message)); };
  var error = function(message) { alert("Error: " + message); };

  // create a calendar (iOS only for now)
  window.plugins.calendar.createCalendar(calendarName,success,error);

  // delete a calendar (iOS only for now)
  window.plugins.calendar.deleteCalendar(calendarName,success,error);

  // create (the only function also supported on Android for now)
  window.plugins.calendar.createEvent(title,location,notes,startDate,endDate,success,error);

  // create in a named calendar (iOS only for now)
  window.plugins.calendar.createEventInNamedCalendar(title,location,notes,startDate,endDate,calendarName,success,error);

  // find (iOS only for now)
  window.plugins.calendar.findEvent(title,location,notes,startDate,endDate,success,error);

  // find all events in a named calendar (iOS only for now)
  window.plugins.calendar.findAllEventsInNamedCalendar(calendarName,success,error);

  // change an event (iOS only for now)
  var newTitle = "New title!";
  window.plugins.calendar.modifyEvent(title,location,notes,startDate,endDate,newTitle,location,notes,startDate,endDate,success,error);

  // delete (iOS only for now)
  // note that it deletes all matching events, which are duplicates anyway
  window.plugins.calendar.deleteEvent(newTitle,location,notes,startDate,endDate,success,error);
```

Creating an all day event:

```javascript
  // set the startdate to midnight and set the enddate to midnight the next day
  var startDate = new Date("September 24, 2013 00:00:00");
  var endDate = new Date("September 25, 2013 00:00:00");
```

Creating an event for 3 full days

```javascript
  // set the startdate to midnight and set the enddate to midnight 3 days later
  var startDate = new Date("September 24, 2013 00:00:00");
  var endDate = new Date("September 27, 2013 00:00:00");
```


## 4. CREDITS ##

This plugin was enhanced for Plugman / PhoneGap Build by [Eddy Verbruggen](http://www.x-services.nl). I fixed some issues in the native code (mainly for iOS) and changed the JS-Native functions a little in order to make a universal JS API for both platforms.
